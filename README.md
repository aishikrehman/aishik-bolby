# Installation
1. Download the .xml file from this repository
2. Backup your existing theme to avoid any itching-bitching situation (: [hint. Theme>Customise>Backup]
3. Restore the theme with aishik-bolby.xml file from your device. [hint. Theme>Customise>Restore]
4. Check the radio button Desktop in Theme>Customise>Mobile Settings. (It must be done! Otherwise the UI will look awkward on mobile devices)
